2. **Personalized Content:** Deepfakes enable marketers to tailor content to specific  audiences, enhancing the relevance and resonance of their messages.

3. **Content Repurposing  and Redistribution:** Deepfakes can be  easily repurposed and redistributed across multiple channels  extending the reach and lifespan of marketing campaigns.
